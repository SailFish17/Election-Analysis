# Election-Analysis

## Purpose

A Colorado Board of Elections is worried that it will be sued by a candidate over the election results.   They have asked for a bullet proof code to audit the recent elections.
The code should answer the following questions:

 1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
 2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
 3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidates received.
 4. Calculate the percentage of veotes each candidate won.
 5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources and Challenges

The code is written in Python with the use of VSCODE, an IDE by Microsoft.  Both of these resources proved to be completely unreliable and confounding despite significant help with the platforms.  A complete computer rebuild is pending in order to review and ensure futher computational work is sound.  The code did spit out the results in the a txt file as asked but would not upload to GitHub until a 2 hour session with the BCS helpdesk worked thru several problems that were encountered.

## Results:
The following analysis was output to the txt file.  The analysis the election show that:
    -	There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.
    - The candidates were:
      - Charles Casper Stockham
      - Diana DeGette
      - Raymon Anthony Doane
    - The candidate Results were:
